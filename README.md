### Loader State and Lazy Loading

Added a loader for the time data is fetched from the NASA's api. Also implemented lazy loading alongside the loader so that only some of the images are fetched initially and the rest are fetched only when the user scrolls down to the bottom of the page.

### Saving Liked Images

The images liked by a user are saved to the local storage of their browser so that they are persisted even if the user goes away or refreshes the page.

### BackGround Particles

Made a nice animation in background. There are particles which seems like the planets in the space.

### Shareable Links

Users can copy the image link by clicking the copy icon on each image, so that they can then share it.
